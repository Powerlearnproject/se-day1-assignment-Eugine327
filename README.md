Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the engineeering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. 
It is imporatnt in the creation of software applications and systems that powers various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Research and strategy. An expert compiles and assess customer requirements which they communicate to the development team after creating use cases
2.Developing the product architecture and design. a systems architecture sets the guidelines and acts an an interface foe managing complexity in design and establishing cooperation and consultation among components. the general structure of the system determines the design and architecture, but essential internal details are disregarded.
3. software development. The aim is to produce programs that adresses a users issue. by yhe developers who account for large portion of the initial building softwares applications that will solve problems give amusemnt or make things easier for its target demographic based on the the organisation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1.Requirements. gathering and documentation of user needs and system requiremnts.
 2.Design. Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architectuer and user interface 
 3. Implementaion. Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
 4. Testing. Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requiremnts
 5.Deployment. Releasing the software to users or customers 
 6. Maintainance. Providing ongoing support updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfalll methodology reefers to a sequentila  approach with distinct phases that bfocuses on requirements, design,  implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall whie Agile methodology is an interative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions
A quality assuarance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control,debugging tools and automated testing capabilities. such tolls in IDEs include visual studio, eclipse and VCS include Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays 
pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
technical debt acrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions that impedes future development efforts and increase mainatainance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing. testing individual components or modules of software 
System testing. testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing. testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
 quality assuarance is important as it helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products
 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI modPromp engineering 
Is about creating systems that can perform tasks that usually rquire human intelligence 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Chatgpt  give it an AI identity, add tone, add background text, direct the lenght of rsponse, ask the AI questions. the prompt is more effective because it proides clear instructions and sets boundaries for the response leading to a more informative answer
